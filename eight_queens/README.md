# Eight Queens

This is a practice project. I solve eight queens problem by 4 programming languages.

* cpp
* java
* python
* javascript


## How to Build

I use cmake to generate Makefile. you can find the cmake with the link <http://www.cmake.org/>

### CPP

~~~
$ cd cpp/project
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
~~~

The execuatable file will be created in the `build` folder.

~~~
$ cd java
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
~~~

The eight_queens.jar will be created in the `build` folder.

You can also import this project into Eclipse.
